How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?
  //38


What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?

  //Second is giving margin same line number as the first.
  //Third means that it prints every 10th line.





How many times does the loop body run each frame, once the x and y arrays are full?
  51/30 second.

What are two ways of increasing the spacing between rings?
  one, give larger number of in "i = i + 1" in for loop
  two, multiply number with (x.length - i) in size of ellipse. ( 1 + (x.length - i) ).


How can you make the ellipse trail longer?
  Giving more negative number in .slice(). ex> x.slice(-100); & y.slice(-100)
