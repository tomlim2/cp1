Your Project Title Here
  Environment Sphere.


Summary
  Environment changes slow, but steady. This point makes people easy to ignore the change happening right now. The purpose of this abstract data visualization of geometric changes, and climate changes is for showing data changes of earth to draw people’s attention to think earth environment. I want to show data every year or months to show that data change of this earth.


Component Parts
  Data:
    API or Jason

  Input = Output:
    Data = Sphere-shaped vertexes contain data
      upper-part = climate changes (temperature, co2…)
      middle-part = surface changes (ice berg, surface area, …)
      bottom-part = sea changes (temperature, sea level, …)
    Mouse X move = change year
    Mouse Drag = Rotate X or Y the sphere

  Software:
    P5, WebGL

  Completed work:
    Website (full screen)




  Challenges
    Finding and importing trust-worth API data
    Ways to move vertexes using vector.
    How to animate those move.
